### The Short Version

I am a mechanic and engineer in data science, but my interests cover very different social and business topics. So I have gained professional experience in industrial companies, retail groups, politics and health care. Over the years I have continued my education, so that I graduated from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences with a degree in data analysis and process design and from the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil with a master degree in software engineering. I have specialized in sensors and actuators. I completed my most recent further education in Tourism 4.0 at the University of Applied Sciences Graubünden in 2020.
